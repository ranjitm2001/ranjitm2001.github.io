                <h2>The Beginning: NITK Surathkal</h2>
                <p>
                    In 2012, I joined the National Institute of Technology Karnataka (NITK), Surathkal to pursue a 
                    B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering. Like many students, I chose the branch based on JEE rank and 
                    societal expectations rather than a deep passion for mechanics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During my second year, I discovered programming. What started as a curiosity about how things 
                    worked behind the screen turned into an obsession. I spent nights learning C++, building small 
                    projects, and participating in coding competitions.
                </p>

                <h2>The Pivot Point: Bosch (2016-2019)</h2>
                <p>
                    When I graduated in 2016 with a CGPA of 8.88, I joined Bosch as a Software Developer. Yes, a 
                    mechanical engineer as a software developer\! This was possible because Bosch was developing 
                    embedded software for automotive systems, where mechanical and software engineering intersect.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At Bosch, I worked on:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Microcontroller software using C++ and RTOS</li>
                    <li>Communication protocols: CAN, Ethernet, SPI</li>
                    <li>Design patterns for embedded systems</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This experience taught me the importance of <strong>reliability</strong>. When your code runs on 
                    a car's braking system, there's no room for bugs. I learned to write defensive code, implement 
                    proper error handling, and think about edge cases obsessively.
                </p>

                <h2>Aerospace Adventure: Airbus (2019-2022)</h2>
                <p>
                    From automotive to aerospace\! At Airbus, I worked as both a Software Engineer and Project Manager. 
                    This dual role was challenging but incredibly educational.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Technical highlights:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Built software using Java, Spring, and Azure</li>
                    <li>Optimized PRA (Probabilistic Risk Assessment) analysis, saving 3 hours per task</li>
                    <li>Led a team of 4 engineers delivering complex engineering models</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The project management experience taught me how to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Communicate technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders</li>
                    <li>Balance technical debt with delivery timelines</li>
                    <li>Manage team dynamics and individual growth</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Startup World: Vahak (2022-2023)</h2>
                <p>
                    After years in large corporations, I wanted to experience the startup world. Vahak, a logistics 
                    platform, offered exactly that challenge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here, I:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Learned Golang from scratch and became proficient in weeks</li>
                    <li>Built authentication systems (RBAC, JWT) reducing unauthorized access by 50%</li>
                    <li>Optimized ElasticSearch queries improving performance by 35%</li>
                    <li>Created a WhatsApp chatbot that reduced response time from 3 hours to 2 minutes</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The startup pace was exhilarating. Decisions that took months in corporations happened in days. 
                    But with speed came the responsibility to build things right the first time.
                </p>

                <h2>AI Revolution: Kognitos (2023)</h2>
                <p>
                    At Kognitos, I got my first deep exposure to AI/ML in production. The company was building 
                    AI-powered automation agents, and I contributed to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>AWS Textract integration for document processing</li>
                    <li>LLM-based automation reducing manual processing by 40%</li>
                    <li>Cost optimization cutting AWS bills by 65%</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This experience showed me that AI isn't magic—it's engineering. The same principles of clean 
                    architecture, testing, and monitoring apply, just with probabilistic outputs instead of 
                    deterministic ones.
                </p>

                <h2>Leadership: Osfin.ai (2023-2025)</h2>
                <p>
                    As Engineering Manager at Osfin.ai, I transitioned from individual contributor to people leader. 
                    Managing a team of 6 engineers while staying hands-on was the biggest challenge yet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Key achievements:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Built a Unified Dispute Management System reducing action time from 2 hours to 2 minutes</li>
                    <li>Implemented enterprise SSO with SAML and LDAP</li>
                    <li>Built ETL pipelines processing 250M+ records</li>
                    <li>Promoted 3 engineers to SDE2</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The most rewarding part? Seeing engineers I mentored grow and take on bigger challenges.
                </p>

                <h2>Today: Tekion Corp (2025-Present)</h2>
                <p>
                    Now at Tekion as Lead Software Engineer, I'm building AI-powered solutions for the automotive 
                    industry. It feels like coming full circle—from Bosch's automotive embedded systems to 
                    Tekion's automotive SaaS platform.
                </p>

                <h2>Lessons for Career Switchers</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Your background is an asset, not a liability.</strong> My mechanical engineering 
                        foundation helped me understand systems thinking, optimization, and reliability—skills 
                        that directly apply to software.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Learn by doing.</strong> I didn't take a bootcamp or get a CS master's. I built 
                        projects, contributed to open source, and learned on the job.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Seek bridge opportunities.</strong> Bosch's embedded software role was perfect 
                        because it valued my mechanical background while letting me grow in software.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Be patient but persistent.</strong> It took 9 years to go from junior developer 
                        to Engineering Lead. Each role built on the previous one.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Stay curious.</strong> Technology changes fast. I've gone from C++ to Java to 
                        Golang to Python. The willingness to learn new things is more important than any specific skill.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h2>What's Next?</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm excited about the intersection of AI and software engineering. Contributing to projects like 
                    Spring AI keeps me at the cutting edge while giving back to the community that helped me grow.
                </p>
